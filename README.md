# Two-stage-op-Amp

# Abstract:
An Operational amplifier is consider to 
be the most imperative electronic device. The 
procedure in this paper is to design a two stage 
CMOS operational amplifier and analyze the effect 
of various parameters on the characteristics of Op-amp design. This work presents a design and 
implementation of two stage CMOS operational 
amplifier which operates at ±400mv supply voltage 
and Simulation process is carried out by using an 
EDA tool Synopsys with 28nm technology. The 
obtained gain is 84dB. with phase margin of 560
and the power dissipation is of 38.02μW.
